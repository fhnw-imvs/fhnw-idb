# Reading a DHT temperature & humidity sensor

How to read and visualize a DHT sensor with Python on a Raspberry Pi. 

The example is based on the information found in:

- the [SEEED Docs](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Seeed_Python_DHT)
- this [post](https://www.deviceplus.com/raspberry-pi/lets-build-mobile-gadget-using-compact-raspberry-pi-zero-build-environment-check-device-using-grove-sensor/)

## Hardware
* [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://github.com/fhnw-idb/fhnw-idb/wiki/Raspberry-Pi-Zero-W) controller.
* [Grove Base Hat for Raspberry Pi](https://github.com/fhnw-idb/fhnw-idb/wiki/Grove-Adapters#grove-base-hat-for-raspberry-pi) to connect sensors.
* [DHT11](https://github.com/fhnw-idb/fhnw-idb/wiki/Grove-Sensors#temperature--humidity-sensor-dht11) wired to Grove _D16_ (Raspberry Pi _Pin 16_) (see figure 1).

## Running the example

1. Check that the library `grove.py` is installed on your Raspberry Pi, with:

    ```shell
    $ pip3 show grove.py
    Name: grove.py
    Version: 0.6
    Summary: Python library for Seeedstudio Grove devices
    ...
    ```

2. Check that the library `seeed-python-dht` is installed on your Raspberry Pi, with:

    ```shell
    $ pip3 show seeed-python-dht
    Name: grove.py
    Version: 0.0.2

    ...
    ```



3. Download the file [`dht.py`](dht.py) on to your Raspberry Pi.

   This is a small python program using the DHT sensor, which is connected to PIN D16, to read out the temperature and humidity and to print these values to the console, including a timestamp.

   Note that this program has no main loop.

4. Run the program with

   ```shell
   $ python3 dht.py
   09:19:45,25,53
   ```

   As you can see, the sensor is read just once. The values are separated by a comma, to be prepared to create a cvs file for Excel.

## Create Excel file (format csv)

The console output can be redirected into a file, with:

```shell
$ python3 dht.py > dht.csv
```

The `cron` system application can be used to schedule a program at a given interval. 

1. On your Raspberry Pi load the crontab file into a editor:

   ```shell
   $ crontab -e
   ```

2. Add the following entry:

   ```shell
   * * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /home/pi/dht/dht.py >> /tmp/dht.csv 
   ```

   Adding this entry, `cron` will schedule the program `dht.py` **each minute** and append the console output to file `/tmp/dht.csv`.

   **Note**: 

   - The path entries must match your setup!

3. Save the crontab file.

4. `cron` will now run the program each minute. Check if the values are appended to file `dht.csv`.

## Visualize and Analyse the sensor values

1. Copy the file `dht.csv` to your computer and import this file into Excel. 

2. Create a diagram to visualize the temperature and humidity. You should get something like shown in figure 2.

3. Analyse the data for wrong or missing values. It can happen! The sensor is cheap!

4. **Improve the program, if necessary.** You should have a reasonable output in the end.

## Option

Use a Jupyter notebook.
