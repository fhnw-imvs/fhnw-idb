# Reading a DHT temperature & humidity sensor
How to read and visualize a DHT sensor with CircuitPython.

## Dependencies

You will need to download and to install the library `adafruit_dht.mpy`. You can find it as part of the [Adafruit CircuitPython Library Bundle](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_Bundle#adafruit-circuitpython-library-bundle). Download manually the latest release, but check first that it matches with your CircuitPython version. 

The libraries in each release are compiled for all recent major versions of CircuitPython. Please download the one that matches the major version of your CircuitPython. For example, if you are running 6.0.0 you should download the 6.x bundle.

## Running the example
* Set up the [hardware](#Hardware), connect it to your computer via USB.
* Copy the content of [dht.py](dht.py) to _code.py_ on the _CIRCUITPY_ drive.
* Copy the library `adafruit_dht.mpy` into the folder `lib` on the _CIRCUITPY_ drive.
* Consider opening the [serial plotter](https://codewith.mu/en/tutorials/1.0/plotter) (available if you are using the [Mu Python editor](https://github.com/fhnw-imvs/fhnw-idb/wiki/Mu-Python-editor)).

**Note**, that the timestamps are not synchronized with the actual time. We are not using a battery-buffered Real Time Clock (RTC).

## Hardware
* [Feather nRF52840 Express](https://github.com/fhnw-imvs/fhnw-idb/wiki/Feather-nRF52840-Express) microcontroller.
* [Grove shield for Feather](https://github.com/fhnw-imvs/fhnw-idb/wiki/Grove-Adapters#grove-shield-for-feather) to connect sensors.
* [DHT11](https://github.com/fhnw-imvs/fhnw-idb/wiki/Grove-Sensors#temperature--humidity-sensor-dht11) wired to Grove _D4_ (nRF52840 _D9_) (see figure 1).

## Visualize and Analyse the sensor values

### Create Excel file (format csv)

The console output can be copied and pasted into an excel file.

1. Open a new text file.

2. Create the column header with `Time,Temp,Hum`.

2. Copy and paste the values from the console into the text file. Separate the columns with a comma.

3. Save the file as `dht.csv`.

### Visualize

Using Jupyter notebook (Option 1):

1. Open the given Jupyter notebook [`dht.ipynb`](./dht.ipynb).

2. Check the filename of the csv-file, which is loaded into the notebook.

3. Run the notebook. You should get something, as shown in figure 3.

Using Excel (Option 2):

1. Create a diagram to visualize the temperature and humidity. You should get something, as shown in figure 4:

### Analyse

Analyse the data for wrong or missing values. This can happen! The sensor is cheap! **Improve the program, if necessary.** You should have a reasonable output in the end.
